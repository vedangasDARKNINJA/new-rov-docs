## Abstract

Remotely operated vehicles (ROV) are remote control underwater robots driven by an individual on the surface. This robot consists of embedded systems, mechanical systems and it is tethered by a series of load carrying umbilical cables which includes cables for power, data transmission as well as control signals for the ROV. The objective of this project is to design a navigation system to maneuver the ROV underwater to perform oil extraction activities. This is achieved by implementing different subsystems and developing a communication link to operate it from the surface. Different subsystems include an altitude control system, cameras and lamp for vision, thrusters, sensors and communication network. Performance is evaluated in its accuracy to reach the designated position smoothly and maintain its buoyancy.
