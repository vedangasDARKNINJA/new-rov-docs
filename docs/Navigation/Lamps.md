1. They were procured from a Delhi distributor, DS water technology. They are rated 12V 2A IP68. 3 lamps were proposed to be used for the operation, along with 1 as spare. See power supply 2, calculations and SLD diagrams, for details.
2. The testing was done by turning on the 4 lamps in air for 4 hours. The current was monitored (1.7A per lamp approx.) and considered when calculating power supply 2 requirements.
3. The mounting of lamps is yet to be done, as the previous mounting positions, i.e. behind either arm, would collide with the arms in their retracted positions. New mounting positions are to be set
